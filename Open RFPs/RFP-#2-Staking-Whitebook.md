**Published by:** Golem Factory  
**Funding Source:** Golem Network Ecosystem Fund  
**Status:** Open  
**Funding Amount:** Determined based on proposal specifics and milestones  

---

## Overview

The **Staking Whitebook** is a comprehensive, open-source guide aimed at helping individuals and organizations stake Ethereum independently using cost-effective hardware like Raspberry Pi devices. This guide will draw from our extensive experience in staking 40,000 ETH, which included securing staking operations across multiple testnets and mainnet, implementing high-security protocols, and testing hardware configurations like Raspberry Pi.

The Whitebook will incorporate key insights from our recent staking experiments, including the methods used to optimize validator infrastructure, enhance security, and reduce hardware costs. The goal is to provide a practical, tested framework for Ethereum staking on affordable hardware, enabling more people to participate in staking securely and efficiently.

## Scope of Work

The Staking Whitebook will cover the following essential areas:

1. **Best Practices and Security Guidelines**  
   - A comprehensive section on security practices essential for staking on Raspberry Pi, including the use of multisig contracts, network isolation, and hardware configuration to ensure optimal safety and reliability.

2. **Step-by-Step Setup Instructions**  
   - Detailed instructions for setting up and managing validators on Raspberry Pi hardware. This will cover our tested process from initial setup to large-scale deployments, including software installations, client configuration, and performance tuning.

3. **Cost-Effective Staking Solutions**  
   - Guidelines on using Raspberry Pi as a low-cost, sustainable solution for Ethereum staking, with insights on balancing affordability with security. This will include recommendations for additional components like storage solutions, thermal management, and redundancy setups.

4. **Risk Management Strategies**  
   - An outline of risk mitigation techniques, based on our operational security practices. This includes strategies like isolated staking pools, monitoring for performance issues, and handling network downtimes or hardware malfunctions.

5. **Scaling Validator Infrastructure**  
   - Insights from our experience in scaling validator operations to thousands of validators, adapted for Raspberry Pi hardware. This section will provide strategies for organizations interested in securely scaling their staking infrastructure while managing high validator counts on affordable devices.

## Project Impact

The Staking Whitebook is expected to:

- **Increase Accessibility**: By focusing on Raspberry Pi as a staking solution, the Whitebook will lower technical and financial barriers, making Ethereum staking achievable for a broader audience.
- **Enhance Network Security**: More validators using secure, affordable setups will increase Ethereum’s decentralization and resilience.
- **Share Knowledge**: The Whitebook will serve as an open, centralized resource that standardizes best practices, allowing new and existing stakers to confidently engage in staking.


## Why Support This Project?

This project reflects Golem Network’s commitment to strengthening Ethereum. By sharing our findings from extensive staking tests on testnets, mainnet, and Raspberry Pi devices, the Whitebook will offer the Ethereum community a reliable, open-source guide to independent staking.


## Deliverables

1. **Staking Whitebook Document**  
   - A structured, open-source document covering the areas outlined above, with practical examples and best practices based on our real-world staking experience with Raspberry Pi.

2. **Implementation Guide Examples**  
   - Configuration guides and practical examples for staking setups on Raspberry Pi, providing scalable and secure solutions tailored to individual and organizational needs.

3. **Security and Feasibility Assessment**  
   - An assessment of security practices, risk management strategies, and the scalability of Raspberry Pi staking setups, grounded in our comprehensive testing on mainnet and testnet environments.
