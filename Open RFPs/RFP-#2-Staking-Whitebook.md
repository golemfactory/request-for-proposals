# RFP #2: Staking Whitebook – Open-Source Guide to Ethereum Staking

**Published by:** Golem Factory  
**Funding Source:** Golem Network Ecosystem Fund  
**Status:** Open  
**Funding Amount:** Determined based on proposal specifics and milestones  

---

## 1. Overview

The **Staking Whitebook** project addresses the gap in clear, consolidated guidance for staking ETH independently. While scattered information exists, there is no comprehensive, open-source guide covering the practical steps and best practices for independent staking across various hardware setups.

We need you to conduct in-depth research, compile it, and organize the insights gained, including those from Golem's hands-on testing during our staking process. You will document actionable steps for different staking platforms, evaluating each for cost-effectiveness, security, and performance.

The outcome will be the guide we wish we had. This guide will support the broader mission of Golem in empowering individuals with decentralized technology. Golem aims to make staking more accessible by providing a clear, actionable resource to help users navigate the complexities of independent staking. Ultimately, this will contribute to a stronger and more decentralized network, guiding both new and experienced stakers in setting up and managing their nodes effectively.

## 2. Scope of Work

The Staking Whitebook will cover key areas for Ethereum stakers across platforms, including:

1. **Best Practices and Security Guidelines**  
   - Detailed security practices specifically for staking on diverse hardware, covering best practices for securing network configuration, multisig setups, and hardware choices.

2. **Step-by-Step Setup Instructions**  
   - Detailed, step-by-step instructions for setting up and managing staking nodes on various hardware options, including Raspberry Pi, consumer-grade desktops, and specialized devices. Covers initial installation, client configuration, and techniques for optimizing performance.

3. **Platform Comparisons and Cost-Effectiveness**  
   - Comparative analysis of hardware options, outlining pros and cons of each platform with recommendations on balancing costs with security, including considerations for storage, cooling, and redundancy.

4. **Risk Management Strategies**  
   - Techniques for risk mitigation, including setup for isolated staking pools, methods for monitoring issues, and handling downtimes or hardware failures.

5. **Scaling Validator Infrastructure**  
   - Guidance on scaling validator setups across platforms, with strategies for managing higher validator counts while keeping infrastructure secure and cost efficient.


## 3. Project Goals

This Whitebook project aims to make Ethereum staking more accessible by providing guidance across multiple hardware options. It includes a balanced comparison of platforms, detailing their strengths and limitations to help reduce technical and financial barriers for a wide range of users.

The goal is to create a resource that supports individuals and organizations in setting up staking nodes, managing risks, and optimizing operations. This Whitebook will outline best practices to serve as a centralized resource for the Ethereum community.

## 4. Deliverables

1. **Staking Whitebook Document**  
   - A structured, open-source document based on testing across different hardware setups, covering security practices, platform comparisons, and best practices for Ethereum staking, with practical examples.

2. **Implementation Guide Examples**  
   - Configuration guides for staking on various platforms, including Raspberry Pi, desktops, and servers, with specific configurations tested for performance, stability, and resilience.


3. **Security and Feasibility Assessment**  
   - An evaluation of security measures, risk management techniques, and the reliability of staking setups tested across mainnet and testnet environments, including performance under network and hardware stress.
