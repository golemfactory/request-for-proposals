# Request for Proposals

We are building an ecosystem to empower developers, researchers, and entrepreneurs in realizing their visions by advancing the Golem and Ethereum networks, delivering optimal solutions for global demand, backed by a 40,000 ETH stake, with 75% of rewards currently allocated to beneficiaries, and potential adjustments based on program performance.

This repository is dedicated to the **Request for Proposals (RFP)** process, serving as a hub for collaboration and innovation within the Golem Network. Here our Core Team outlines specific projects, features, and areas of research that align with our development needs. By providing detailed RFPs, we aim to clearly communicate our strategic priorities and the opportunities available for contributors. 

We invite all contributors interested in taking on these RFPs to apply for funding through the Golem Ecosystem Fund.

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized into two main sections:
- **Open RFPs**: Projects currently available for proposal submissions.
- **Closed RFPs**: Previously funded or completed RFPs for reference.

To apply for an RFP, please visit our [ecosystem page](https://ecosystem.golem.network/) and submit your application through our website form. We encourage all interested contributors to provide detailed proposals that outline their approach, timeline, and resources needed to accomplish the project’s objectives.

Our team is committed to reviewing each submission thoroughly and will provide feedback or guidance to help refine your proposal if necessary.

## Proposal Review Process

1. **Submit Your Application**: Review the open RFPs provided by Golem and select a project that aligns with your expertise and interests. In your application, outline your proposed approach to fulfilling the project objectives. Include relevant information that demonstrates your capability to successfully complete the project.

2. **Review and Approval**: The Golem Team, in collaboration with the community, will evaluate applications based on potential feasibility and alignment with Golem’s goals.

3. **Milestones and Funding**: Once approved, clear project milestones will be established, tailored to the specific RFP. Funding will be disbursed incrementally upon the successful completion of each milestone, providing resources to support your progress while ensuring accountability and alignment with project objectives.

### Have an Idea Outside of RFPs?
If you have an original idea for the Golem Network that isn’t part of our listed RFPs, we’d still love to hear from you! Visit our [ecosystem page](https://ecosystem.golem.network/) to submit your idea. Make sure your proposal aligns with our guidelines and requirements, as detailed on the bottom of the page, to increase its chances of being accepted for funding.
