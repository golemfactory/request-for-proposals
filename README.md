# Request for Proposals

We are building an ecosystem to empower developers, researchers, and entrepreneurs in realizing their visions by advancing the Golem and Ethereum networks, delivering optimal solutions for global demand, backed by a 40,000 ETH stake, with 75% of rewards currently allocated to beneficiaries, and potential adjustments based on program performance.

This repository is dedicated to the **Request for Proposals (RFP)** process, serving as a hub for collaboration and innovation within the Golem Network. Here our Core Team outlines specific projects, features, and areas of research that align with our development needs. By providing detailed RFPs, we aim to clearly communicate our strategic priorities and the opportunities available for contributors. 

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized into two main sections:
- **Open RFPs**: Projects currently available for proposal submissions.
- **Closed RFPs**: Previously funded or completed RFPs for reference.

To apply for an RFP, please visit our [ecosystem page](https://ecosystem.golem.network/) and submit your application manually. Although we aim to move to a fully transparent, Git-based application process in the future, applications are currently processed through our website form.

## Proposal Review Process
1. **Internal Review**: Every proposal is first reviewed internally to ensure it meets our guidelines and requirements, as listed at the bottom of our [ecosystem fund page](https://ecosystem.golem.network/). Proposals that do not meet these standards will be either returned for revision or rejected.

2. **Community Review**: Once a proposal passes the internal review, it will be shared publicly to gather community feedback. This step helps us gauge whether the community sees value in the proposed project, considers it beneficial, and offers any additional insights or suggestions.

### Have an Idea Outside of RFPs?
If you have an original idea for the Golem Network that isn’t part of our listed RFPs, we’d still love to hear from you! Visit our [ecosystem page](https://ecosystem.golem.network/) to submit your idea. Make sure your proposal aligns with our guidelines and requirements, as detailed on the bottom of the page, to increase its chances of being accepted for funding.
