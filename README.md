# Request for Proposals

We are building an ecosystem to empower developers, researchers, and entrepreneurs in realizing their visions by advancing the Golem and Ethereum networks, delivering optimal solutions for global demand, backed by a 40,000 ETH stake, with 75% of rewards currently allocated to beneficiaries, and potential adjustments based on program performance.

This repository is dedicated to the **Request for Proposals (RFP)** process, serving as a hub for collaboration and innovation within the Golem Network. Here our Core Team outlines specific projects, features, and areas of research that align with our development needs. By providing detailed RFPs, we aim to clearly communicate our strategic priorities and the opportunities available for contributors. 

We invite all contributors interested in taking on these RFPs to apply for funding through the Golem Ecosystem Fund.

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized into two main sections:
- **Open RFPs**: Projects currently available for proposal submissions.
- **Closed RFPs**: Previously funded or completed RFPs for reference.

To apply for an RFP, please visit our [ecosystem page](https://ecosystem.golem.network/) and submit your application through our website form. We encourage all interested contributors to provide detailed proposals that outline their approach, timeline, and resources needed to accomplish the project’s objectives.

Our team is committed to reviewing each submission thoroughly and will provide feedback or guidance to help refine your proposal if necessary.

## Proposal Review Process

For full details on the application process, please refer to the [ecosystem fund page](https://ecosystem.golem.network/). Below is an overview of the key steps involved:

1. **Submit Your Application**: Select an open RFP that aligns with your expertise and interests. In your application, outline your approach to achieving the project objectives, including relevant information that demonstrates your capability to successfully complete the project.

2. **Review and Approval**: Each proposal is reviewed internally by the Golem Team to ensure it meets our guidelines and requirements. Once internally approved, the proposal will be shared publicly for community feedback to gauge its perceived value and gather additional insights. 

3. **Milestones and Funding**: Approved projects will have clear milestones established in collaboration with the Golem Team. Funding will be disbursed incrementally upon the completion of each milestone, helping support progress while ensuring alignment with project objectives.

For more comprehensive guidelines and specific requirements, please consult the bottom of our [ecosystem fund page](https://ecosystem.golem.network/).

If you have an original idea for the Golem Network that isn’t part of our listed RFPs, we’d still love to hear from you! Visit our [ecosystem page](https://ecosystem.golem.network/) to submit your idea. Make sure your proposal aligns with our guidelines and requirements, as detailed on the bottom of the page, to increase its chances of being accepted for funding.
